## [Unreleased]

### Added
* Allow use of installed pybind11, cereal and jrl-cmakemodules via cmake
* Add compatibility with jrl-cmakemodules workspace ([#339](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/pull/339))
* Specifically mention that timings are in microseconds ([#340](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/pull/340))
* Fix cereal include directory in cmake ([#340](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/pull/340))
* Extend doc with hint for conda installation from source ([#340](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/pull/340))

## [0.6.6] - 2024-06-15

### Fixed
* Fix infeasibility detection and add a unit test ([#328](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite/pull/328))

## [0.6.0] - 2023-11-13

### News
We add the implementation of [QPLayer](https://inria.hal.science/hal-04133055/file/QPLayer_Preprint.pdf).
**QPLayer** enables to use a QP as a layer within standard learning architectures.
**QPLayer** allows for parallelized calculus over CPUs, and is interfaced with **PyTorch**.
**QPLayer** can also differentiate over LPs.
